# Week-4-Homework

A space for Nanda Girish, Antony Siahaan, Adam Czopp and Linus Kelsey to complete the fourth week of homework for the Encode Club's Solidity bootcamp. This week we have been set the task of creating a voting dApp to perform the same functionality of last week's homework, in which we deployed a tokenised ballot. This time around we need to create the frontend as well as a backend, connected through APIs, with which our votes can be delegated, placed and recorded to the blockchain (or off-chain).
