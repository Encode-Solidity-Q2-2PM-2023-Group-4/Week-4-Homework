# Week-4-Homework

A space for Nanda Girish, Antony Siahaan, Adam Czopp and Linus Kelsey to complete the fourth week of homework for the Encode Club's Solidity bootcamp. This week we have been tasked with creating a voting dApp to perform the same functionality as last week's homework, in which we deployed a tokenised ballot. This time around we need to create the front and backend, connected through APIs, with which our votes can be delegated, placed and recorded to the blockchain (or off-chain).

### Token and Ballot Deployment

### Frontend Creation

### Backend Creation

### Integration

### Delegation and Voting

## Ideas for implementation
Linus - We could create separate pages in the frontend for each action we want to perform, just like in the example Alchemy dApp when you initialise a project.

## What we're working on right now
Linus - Editing the frontend page to display the correct information.
