# Week 3 Homework

This week, we were tasked with editing a tokenized ballot contract in Solidity and deploying both the voting token and ballot contracts with TypeScript. Once these contracts were deployed, we had to mint a/some voting token(s), transfer them between ourselves and vote. After this had been done, we could check the outcome of the ballot. Task completed by:

## Timeline

### Token Deployment

The token, a mintable ERC20 with voting rights and roles, was deployed at [0x4A3...9A8](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x4A3f928B2909C33A8c27400F109f3C07FB5aE9A8) on the Sepolia testnet. From this point, the deployer can mint and transfer tokens between other members of the group.

### Token Minting

Then, one VoteToken (VTK) was minted by the deployer in transaction hash [0xcea...f59](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xcea65fa47cc7f7ea7db14c2462d5cb310d5eff2a4b059038e294d66c85069f59), ready to be split into four and transferred to the rest of the team:

### Token Transfer

Next, a quarter of the minted supply was transferred to each team member, leaving everyone involved with 0.75 VTK:

### Ballot Deployment

Following this, the tokenised ballot was finally deployed to the blockchain in transaction hash [0xaf3...eda](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xaf34975d5efe17ce3f02ae31bbdfbc8314d47f351b559d419429d6941aea9eda), with proposals Ethereumm, Solana, Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Binance, Avalanche, Fantom and Polygon:
